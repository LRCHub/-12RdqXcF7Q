[00:22.98] Stop the fire, a mockingbird sings my name, laughing, calling me
[00:30.53] Who's the liar?
[00:33.53] Maybe you're in my bones, my blood (oh-oh-oh)
[00:56.03] 
[00:38.09] Take it all, filling me up, I'm empty
[00:43.86] Heartbeats counting down, whoa-oh-oh
[00:48.52] If I could stop the clock, you'd win
[01:06.52] 
[00:54.87] So, whisper the names of your enemies
[01:13.37] 
[00:58.92] There's a darker cloud than what you left inside
[01:02.26] Growing like the winter wind
[01:05.00] I can bear your weight, your words, and selfish pride
[01:08.47] You will not escape this sin
[01:11.73] This is my revenge, I'll take us to the end
[01:15.06] You can watch beneath my skin
[01:17.86] Fear is just a smokescreen, heat is still my friend
[01:21.11] I will use the burn to win
[01:34.11] 
[01:29.69] Whispering
[01:32.33] Falling into a sleepwalk, pacing carefully
[01:37.32] I don't dream
[01:40.17] Closing each chapter without pain
[01:56.67] 
[01:44.62] Silent watch
[01:47.63] There was a time I had a family, everything frozen, halt
[01:55.04] Oh, my numb epiphany
[02:05.04] 
[01:59.53] So, whisper the names of your enemies
[02:18.03] 
[02:03.79] There's a darker cloud than what you left inside
[02:06.99] Growing like the winter wind
[02:09.79] I can bear your weight, your words, and selfish pride
[02:13.16] You will not escape this sin
[02:16.47] This is my revenge, I'll take us to the end
[02:19.73] You can watch beneath my skin
[02:22.64] Fear is just a smokescreen, heat is still my friend
[02:25.94] I will use the burn to win
[02:38.94] 
[02:29.52] This shell, a castle
[02:33.27] These walls will not be scaled (oh-oh)
[02:39.08] You're captured
[02:40.91] It's sick, how things have turned
[02:44.84] And all the lessons learned
[02:58.34] 
[02:49.60] Whisper the names of your enemies
[02:53.07] Whisper the names of your enemies
[02:56.56] I'm not your enemy
[03:05.56] 
[02:58.37] There's a darker cloud than what you left inside
[03:01.67] Growing like the winter wind
[03:04.53] I can bear your weight, your words, and selfish pride
[03:07.90] You will not escape this sin
[03:11.23] This is my revenge, I'll take us to the end
[03:14.50] You can watch beneath my skin
[03:17.22] Fear is just a smokescreen, heat is still my friend
[03:20.73] I will use the burn to win
